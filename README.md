Hello! This is my personal site, and it's nothing fancy. It's built nearly entirely with Flask, lives on a DigitalOcean server, and has 3 primary features at the moment:

1. Landing Page
2. Blog
3. Capstone Project

## Landing Page

The landing page is a simple implementation of a Bootstrap theme which can be found [here](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/grayscale).

## Blog

The blog was built using a simple (but custom built!) CMS. I used SQLAlchemy and SQLite for communicating with the database.

## Capstone Project

For undergrad, my capstone project is a Python web application providing data analysis for a fictional staffing firm and the impact COVID had upon their placements. To do so, I utilized the fictional firm's data (as a .csv) and Johns Hopkins data (also as a .csv), analyzed with a Jupyter notebook.
